                    Since I graduated from college in 2020, I have worked both in the life sciences and education. 
                    However, I realized that I have a passion for technology. So I started learning how to code. I look forward to utilizing my background and newly acquired skills in technology to make the world a better place.

                    <article>
                    My hobbies include reading, cooking, DIY projects, fitness and nutrition. I also have an insatiable appetite for drama, action, and thriller T-Shows. I'm often careful about starting a new show because I know I'll do nothing but binge on it to the end.
